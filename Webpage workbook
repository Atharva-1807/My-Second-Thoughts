  <h1>Second Thoughts</h1>
  <h2 style="padding: 150px; color: #ebdfcf; font-size: 20px;">Looking at the mundane and the obvious, with a new set of eyes.<br><br>
Hello there! Welcome to my website! This is a way of mapping my journey through my studio 'Second Thoughts', here you will find things that I navigated through in this studio, how I shaped my thought process, what were the things I learned as well as some things that I un-learned, all mapped out through this webpage that you are on. This is a completely 'hand-coded' webpage with each and every letter, paragraph, colour, image seen here has been coded by me. I've used HTML and CSS to create this page.<br><br>
The contents on this page have been divided into three main categories: namely;
<ul>
  <li>What gives me Second Thoughts</li>
  <li>What I realized</li>
  <li>How I translated these learnings into my practice</li>
</ul><br><br>
You can go through these sections from the top to bottom, or visit any of these specific sections by clicking on the links in the navigation bar down below.<br><br>
So come take a scroll and have some Second Thoughts!

<h4 id="section1" style="background-color: ivory;">What gives me Second thoughts</h4>
<div class="row">
<div class="column side">
    <h3>Using a lens to observe objects around us.</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 16px;"> The idea of 'Re-looking' was practiced from the start, which lead to uncovering some really interesting insights for me. For example the fact that we use a mirror almost every day, it acts like a piece of self reflection for us, we stand in front of it, dress up, etc. but at the same time, it morphs our existing reality into something different than what we see. Yet we somehow let it have a huge impact on the way we walk and talk, how we present ourselves.
      <br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="mirror.jpg" width="300" height="300"></p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column middle">
    <h3 style="color: white;">Re-Imagine. Re-create. Re-look, Investigate.</h3><br><br>
    <p style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 16px; color: white;"> In the process of this studio, the idea of giving second thoughts to things was developed for me. Initially I had a very mixed understanding of what exactly giving ‘Second thought’ to things means.<br><br><br>

I often associated ‘Second thoughts’ with unsureness, confusion and used in the context of something negative.<br><br>
The words written above, I read in the abstract of the studio, and that left me thinking about the importance of these words in the situation we are in today. With COVID-19, many businesses shutdown, lot of people lost their source of daily income, many were left stranded in unknown cities, the problem of social distancing became more evident in a country with a large population. These were just some of my initial thoughts when reading through the abstract.<br><br><img src="mug.jpg" width="300" height="300" class="center"><br><br>
This activity showed how in order to change or 'Re-Imagine' systems to bring about system changes, one needs to understand the existing system in detail.

    <h3>Finding some interesting observations</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 16px;">
      When I observed 'TIME' through this lens, I could see how something so large, continous and beyond a human beings control, has been compressed to something as tiny as milliseconds and microseconds to suite our human needs. To make our lives more 'structured' and more 'defined', yet we often fail to follow something so arbitrary as time.<br>For us, growth is defined by time, an interestingly, there is no universal common time for humans, instead we have further divided time into timezones for each different continent!
      <br><br><br><img src="time.jpg" width="300" height="300"></p><br><br>
  </div><br><br>

<h3 style="padding: 20px;text-align: center; color: tomato;">How does a lens like this, the one that allows me to look at these minute observations, would help me create newer systems and services? Can it lead me to uncover some hidden details of something like an existing system?</h3><br><br>

<h4 id="section2">What I realized</h4>

    <h3>Investigating the hidden 'gimmicks' and truths of a seemingly attractive product.</h3>

    <h3 style="color: white;">The Age of Colonialization: Why Second thoughts are needed</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 16px; color: white;">
       
       One particular activity in the class which involved us going through a moodboard, that provided visual pleasure and made me hungry at the same time too as it was a moodboard of food! The idea was to categorize these tempting foods based on their look, their presentation, their health benefits, etc. Which was a very fun thing to do, but the insights I took from this, left me pretty skeptical about the things I consume myself everyday, what I think is healthy for me or not.<br><br><br>
       Seemingliy attractive products and services in fact acted as a cloak to cover up some of the unethtical practices in its production process.

I  could see how things we percieved visually, the way they were presented to us, had a large impact on the way we felt about them. A nicely decorated, colourful product would be more appealing to a customer, over its competitor, which might lack these visual features. </strong><br><br><br>
<h3>But this led me to think, how do these problems go unnoticed by consumers? What makes them simply invisible to the eyes of the consumer?</h3><br><br>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 16px; color: white;">When buying a new phone, what catches my eyes, is the features, the design, the camera and things like that, I do not look at the where the materials come from, where the phone is made, who makes this phone. Why am I so indifferent to these things even though they play such a big role in making that phone?

      <br><br><br>
       <h3>How can I look at this aspect of using human 'behavior' and bring this into my practice as a designer?<br><br><br>

    <p style="font-family: 'Google Sans';font-size: 16px;"><img src="real.jpg" width="300" height="300"><br><br>When seeing pictures like these, the first thing that catches my eyes is the luxury and comfort. These pictures make me want to live in such homes. But the larger problems of the real estate industry, similarly the fact that so many in the world lack even a basic roof over their heads is neglected by me.</p><br><br><br><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;padding: 150px; font-size: 50px;">Using these insights and lenses, I proceeded to give a Second Thought to a product that I consumed almost everyday during the time I used to attend the class.<br><br>
  The aim was to look beyond the product I was consuming, into the back-end processes of it and find these hidden truths.<br><br><br><br><img src="raw.png" width="1000" height="600"></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 150px;">RAW Pressery is a product that sells a range of cold-pressed fruit juices. I've been a customer of this product since the beginning of this year, and almost every alternate session of this studio was done with a RAW juice or drink next to me.<br><br>I consumed this product a lot over this month, without ever questioning why I'm choosing this over other such products. 'What has got me hooked onto this?','What do I find fascinating about this product?', 'Is it really healthy for me?' were just some of the questions I encountered when I started thinking about this.<br><br><br>Thus I decided to give 'Second Thoughts' to this product.<br>

<div class="column"><h3 style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-size: 20px; padding: 10px;">What is RAW?<br><br>
  Raw Pressery is a Mumbai  based F&B startup that supply high quality fruit juices, produced using cold-pressed technology. Selling '100% natural cold pressed juices using high pressure processing' is one of the USP of this startup.<br>
  Its main target audience includes; 
  <ul>
    <li>Upper middle class to upper class people</li>
    <li>Health Enthusiasts</li>
    <li>Health Conscious Individuals</li>
    <li>People conscious about quality</li>

</h3><p style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">A collection of raw bottles I've accumulated.</p>
  

</div>
<div class="column"><h3 style="padding: 50px; font-size: 20px; background-color: yellow;">Apart from serving fruit juices, Raw also sells other products like protein milkshakes and almond milk, coconut water, etc.<br><br>
Out of their product range, I have been consuming majorly the protein shakes that they offer.From Banana-honey flavoured drink, to cold coffee, to choco mint flavour, I've tried all the three. (not a fan of choco mint).<br><br>
Apart from these, the juices they sell are very different in combination compared to other such juice brands, right from orange, to aloe lemon, to grapefruit, to coconut water lemonade, all the way to including activated charcoal in it!<br><br>

The usual price of one bottle is about 80 rupees for a bottle of 200ml, which is pretty expensive over other juice/milkshake brands in the market. They claim that their beverages have 'No added sugar' and also have zero preservatives in them which I've seen predominantly on the ad cover of their products. But I'm reminded of the activity I did in class, where visually appealing products sometimes mask some hidden truths. This made me question these claims.<br><br>
The turth can be something totally different from what is seen at face value.<br><br>
Time to verify these claims and see what actually goes into it.

<div class="column"><h3 style="padding: 20px; font-size: 20px; background-color: yellow;">What goes into the ingredients?<br><br>

The ingredients for the protein drinks that I consume, includes;
<ul>
  <li>Skimmed Milk</li>
  <li>Milk protein Isolate</li>
  <li>Maple Syrup</li>
  <li>Sugar</li>
  <li>Coffee Powder</li>
  <li>Lactase</li>
</ul><br><br>

It claims that it has no lactose in it, thus making it safe for lactose intolerant people. The main selling point for the drink is that it includes 18g of protein in it, making upto 30% of an average person's intake.,<br><br>
The nutrient list shows 0 fibre in it. The natural sugar in it is 9.66g, similarly there is also added sugar which is about 2.3g. This totals to 11.9g of sugar, per 200gm of drink!<br>
Hmm, that is pretty high for a health protein drink!

<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px;">What is the manufacturing process? How is the supply chain?</h3><br><br><br>

<p style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 20px; text-align: center; padding: 60px;">Raw currently serves its products in 13 different locations across India. This includes major cities like Pune, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi to name a few. Their retail outreach varies from different modes of selling, they've partenered up with retial stores to sell their products. One can find a bottle anywhere from Godrej nature's basket, to in-flight menus, to many other cold refrigators in malls. They've recently added home delivery as part of their chain, with the aim to reach more customers. For me personally, I find RAW juices and drinks in a famous sweet shop chain in Pune.But the question I ask is this:<br><br>
How are these juices, drinks prepared and how many processes do they go through before they reach me?<br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="sup.jpeg" width="400" height="400"></p>
<ul style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 20px; padding: 80px;">
<li>The first step of the manufacturing process, fresh fruits and vegetables are brought from farmers that have partenered with RAW.</li>
<li>These fruits and veggies are segregated, washed and disinfected to avoid any infections to it at RAW factories and are chopped, ready to be juiced out.</li>
<li>For converting them into juice, RAW uses a technology called High pressure processing, short for HPP, which is the USP of this company, which allows cold pressed extraction of juices from fruits and vegetables. This is what gives their juices that natural feel and also increases shelf-life of the product as RAW claims to not adding any preservatives.</li>
<li>Once the juice is extracted, the packaging is done and the juices are sent of for distribution and sale at different retail outlets.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 30px; text-align: center; padding: 60px; color: tomato;"><strong>One of the most unique part of this supply chain is its delivery leg, seen in Mumbai. RAW uses the famous 'Dabbawala' network in Mumbai to deliver their products to people and retail stores alike. This is a really efficient solution for providing delivery, one that saves a lot on logistics and transport costs, labour and delivery agents cost, and is a good example of using existing systems effectively to solve problems, rather than creating new systems altogether.</strong> <br><br><br><img src="dab.png" width="400" height="400"> </p><br><br><br><br><br>

"Beyond the Bottle"<br><br>
RAW juices and milkshakes are most commonly sold in 200ml bottles seen to the left, with dimensions, 15cm X 5cm height and width respectively.<br><br>
The shape of the bottle is such that, multiple bottles can be packed together, providing mobility owing to its compact shape.<br><br>
The front part of the bottle holds the logo of the brand, name of the particular product item, and some unique features.<br><br>
The logo is pretty minimal with only two colours, white text which spells the name of the brand against a black background. Similarly, the colours on the bottles are different based on the ingredient of the juice.<br><br>
The protein drink bottles I buy have a light brown colour for Cold coffee, and yellow for banana shake.<br><br>
The entire feel and texture of the bottle is very smooth, without any sharp corner or edges, entirely curved. The bottle is pretty compact and is easy to hold as well at the neck. The cap provides a strong seal preventing any spillage.

<div class="column"><h3 style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 30px;">

  The information on the bottle<br><br></h3>
<h3 style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 20px;">
The back of the bottle contains essential information on the ingredients, and the nutrition facts. It also holds other important information like allergen info, manufacturing details, the recycling icons, licenses and the barcod.<br><br>
The neck of the bottle has the price, best before date and date of manufacture.<br><br>
All the information is presented in black and white as colours, and is clearly visible to the naked eye.<br><br>
There is also information on the protein drink itself, with facts about Milk protein isolates and bio-avalability of it, given on the back. Other information includes storage and consumption information.

<div class="column"><h3 style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 20px;">

The material of the bottle<br><br>
The bottle itself is a Polypropylene(PP5) plastic bottle. This information is seen on the bottom of the bottle. PP5 is a re-cyclable plastic, thus making the bottle safe and re-cyclable after disposal. Providing a plastic option for juices is something different from most of the other brands that rely on tetra packed juices, which is impossible to recycle.<br><br>
The outer wrapped cover on the bottle which houses the entire branding, logo and information of the product is a Low density Polyethylene (LDPE) shrink wrap plastic cover. Which is also re-cyclable.<br><br>
The cap of the bottle is also made from the same PP5 material as the bottle itself.<br><br>
RAW pressery has an incentive feature where you can return the bottles you bought to be recycled. The collection of these bottles is done from your own homes.



</h3><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<h3 style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 40px; color: tomato; text-align: center;">Inspite of providing a recycle feature for their bottles, very little information is provided on it. I've personally had trouble contacting them to have my waste bottles collected.</h3><br><br><br>


<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px; padding: 20px;">How is it Marketed?<br><br><br><img src="mar.jpg" width="1000" height="600"></h3><br>
<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px; padding: 80px;">
  RAW markets its products as 'FRESH AND PRESERVATIVES FREE'. Through their ads, they aim to promote a product that is prepared from safe, hygienic and chemical-free processes, that is safe to be consumed by people. They aim to make their ingredients transparent, to highlight use of natural ingredients.<br><br>
  Their popular tagline is 'AND NOTHING ELSE', to communicate the idea that their juices are 100% fruit extract, without any additives.
  </h3><br><br><br>

  <h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px; padding: 20px;">What I realized through these 'Second Thoughts'...</h3>

  <p style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 30px; text-align: center; padding: 60px; color: tomato;">Towards the end of this whole process of giving 'Second Thought' to RAW juices and shakes, I realized a lot of things that I hadn't thought of or even considered about, when I was buying that bottle from my local grocery store. A lot of these things proved to be informative for me, while some opened my eyes and made me think twice about what I was consuming.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 20px;text-align: center; padding: 60px; color: black;">
  For example the fact that RAW promotes 'no added sugar' on the front of the bottle, but the total sugar content including the extra added sugar in my protein drink amounts to 11g for a 200ml drink, which is pretty high for any person to consume.<br><br>
The sodium content in the fruit juices sold by RAW is way higher than the average amount needed for a person.<br><br>
Though the number of chemicals and preservatives are way lower than found in other brands like 'Real' or 'Tropicana', it still doesn't make RAW a totally 'healthy' choice.<br><br>
The re-collection of plastic bottles isn't done, the way it is communicated through their advertising, and I'm stuck with 20 waste bottles lying in my home.</p>

 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h4 id="section3">How I translated these learnings into my practice</h4><br><br><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; padding: 150px;"><img src="ud.jpg" width="1000" height="660"><br><br><br><br><br>

  The entire journey through the studio, made me understand the importance of giving second thoughts to things around us. This understanding helped me shape my final project brief, to design a new system for the 'new normal.'<br><br>
  I was able to question and consider deeper connections of the system instead of the surface interactions, consider value for back-end stakeholders, delve deeper into understanding our supply chain, sourcing from waste and up-cycling to create new products, reducing costs of the products we make and at the same time market our product smartly to the chosen target audience.<br><br><br><br> <img src="hw.jpg" width="900" height="660"><br><br>
  Using these lenses help shape my thought process, we were also able to create an outcome, that had a more 'Inclusive' target audience, instead of a small group.<br><br><br>

  <h3 style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">And Finally...</h3><br><br><br><br>


  <h3 style="font-family: Google Sans; font-size: 25px; color: tomato; text-align: center; padding: 60px;">As another Second Thought that I could give through this process, was to use the waste RAW bottles lying around in my home,alongwith a few other empty plastic containers and Up-cycle them to grow plants.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
