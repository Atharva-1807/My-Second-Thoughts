# My-Second-Thoughts
This is a website I created to map my journey through the studio 'Second Thoughts'.
Hello there! Welcome to my website! This is a way of mapping my journey through my studio 'Second Thoughts', here you will find things that I navigated through in this studio, how I shaped my thought process, what were the things I learned as well as some things that I un-learned, all mapped out through this webpage that you are on. This is a completely 'hand-coded' webpage with each and every letter, paragraph, colour, image seen here has been coded by me. I've used HTML and CSS to create this page.<br><br>
The contents on this page have been divided into three main categories: namely;

  What gives me Second Thoughts
  What I realized
  How I translated these learnings into my practice

You can go through these sections from the top to bottom, or visit any of these specific sections by clicking on the links in the navigation bar down below.<br><br>
So come take a scroll and have some Second Thoughts!
